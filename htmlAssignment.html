<h3>That’s Not My Burnout</h3>
<h4>by Donna Bungard</h4>
<p>Feeling connected and validated by experiences that mirror your own can help you understand how to conquer,
    or at least endure, times of struggle. But what if your struggle looks more like achievement? If you don’t see 
    yourself reflected in accounts of burnout, it can be alienating and make you feel even more alone. If you reach 
    the end destination of burnout by stepping on the gas instead of coasting to a stop, Donna Bungard will show you
     how to recognize that you’re low on fuel and give you a map of rest stops where you can refill your tank.</p>
